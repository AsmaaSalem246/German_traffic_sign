# German Traffic Sign Classification (5 Classes)
 ##  Description
This project applies a **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)** classifier to recognize German traffic signs.  
From the original GTSRB dataset, I selected **5 specific classes only** to train and test the model.

- Used only **5 classes** for simplicity.
